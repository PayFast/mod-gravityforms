PayFast Add-on for Gravity Forms v1.9.*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INTEGRATION:
1. Unzip the module to a temporary location on your computer
2. Install the PayFast plugin:

- On WordPress go to "Plugins" menu.
- Click on add new plugin.
- Click the upload plugin button
- Upload the zipped file.

3. Login to the WordPress Administrator console
4. Go to ‘Plugins’ and activate the PayFast Gravity Forms plugin.
5. Go to ‘Forms’ -> ’Settings’, under ‘General Settings’, select ‘South African Rands’ for currency and click 'Save Settings'.
6. You will then need to create a form with options included from the ‘Pricing Fields’ section and click 'Save'.
7. Go to ‘Forms’ -> ’Settings’ -> ’PayFast’, and add feed settings for PayFast, per form. 
8. Complete the PayFast settings as required, and select 'Test' Mode and 'Debug' for testing purposes.

How can I test that it is working correctly?
If you followed the installation instructions above, the module is in “test” mode and you can test it by creating an invoice and completing the payment cycle through the PayFast sandbox, login with the user account detailed above and make payment using the balance in their wallet.

You will not be able to directly “test” a specific payment method (such as credit card or Instant EFT) in the sandbox, but you don’t really need to. 
The inputs to and outputs from PayFast are exactly the same, no matter which payment method is used, so using the wallet will give you exactly the same results as if you had used another payment method.
